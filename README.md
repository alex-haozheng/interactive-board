# Canvas Drawing Web Application

This is a simple web application demo for visualizing skyline calculations. :)

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Node.js and npm**: Download and install from [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **Python** (version 3.x): Install from [Python Official Website](https://www.python.org/).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [[<repository-url>](https://github.com/alex-haozheng/interactive-board)](https://github.com/alex-haozheng/interactive-board.git)
cd interactive-board
```

### 1. Clone the Repository

Run the following command to initialize npm inside the repository URL.

```bash
npm init -y
```
This will create a `package.json` file and set up the project for any required Node.js dependencies.


---

### 3. Start the Backend

Run the Python Flask application:

```bash
python app.py
```
This will start the backend server, which handles API requests and serves the frontend.

### Accessing the Application
Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to:

```bash
http://127.0.0.1:3000
```
You should now see the application interface where you can interact with the canvas.
